\section{Introduce}

Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field that focuses 
on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual 
information from the world, akin to human vision. 
It encompasses a variety of tasks, including image 
recognition, object detection, and scene understanding, 
which are achieved through the application of algorithms and 
models designed to process and analyze visual data. 
The core objective of computer vision is to automate the 
extraction of meaningful information from images and videos, 
facilitating applications in diverse domains such as 
autonomous driving, surveillance, and medical imaging.
