[22:22:26.458][Build] Recipe returns with error code 12/null on PID 7879.
[22:22:26.459][Build] Does the executable exist? $PATH: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/bin/site_perl:/usr/bin/vendor_perl:/usr/bin/core_perl:/opt/yay/bin:/opt/yay/bin, $Path: undefined, $SHELL: /usr/bin/zsh
[22:22:26.459][Build] Latexmk: Missing input file 'newgeometry.tex' (or dependence on it) from following:
  No file newgeometry.tex.
Latexmk: Sometimes, the -f option can be used to get latexmk
  to try to force complete processing.
  But normally, you will need to correct the file(s) that caused the
  error, and then rerun latexmk.
  In some cases, it is best to clean out generated files before rerunning
  latexmk after you've corrected the files.
